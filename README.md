Welcome to the C# Principles Repository! This project contains various C# applications demonstrating fundamental programming concepts and principles using the C# language. Each folder corresponds to a specific topic or principle, showcasing examples and best practices.

The project is organized into folders, each representing a core concept of C#:

Delegate-23: Understanding delegates in C#. LinkedList-34: Implementation of a linked list data structure. ListAndDictionary-36: Usage of lists and dictionaries. NumberSystem-test-36: Working with number systems. OperatorOverloading-15: Examples of operator overloading. ProcessAndThread-37: Demonstrating threading and process management. Queue-33: Implementation of queue data structure. Assembly-29: Working with assemblies in C#. Attributes-29: Custom and built-in attributes. Enumerators-27: Using enumerators in collections. Event-14: Event handling in C#. Exceptions-25: Exception handling best practices. ExtensionMethods-24: Creating and using extension methods. GenericDelegate-24: Understanding generic delegates. Inheritance-22: Demonstrating inheritance principles. Interface-22: Working with interfaces in C#. Project1 OOP: Object-oriented programming concepts. ReflectionAndMetaData: Using reflection in C#. Stack-33: Implementation of stack data structure. StreamAndIO-35: Working with file streams and I/O operations. XML Documentation-27: Creating XML documentation for projects.

This repository covers multiple fundamental topics, including but not limited to:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Data Structures (Lists, Queues, Stacks) Delegates and Events Exception Handling Inheritance and Polymorphism Reflection and Metadata Operator Overloading Generic Programming Asynchronous Programming
